# MEPHISTO
Mephisto is a Linux Kernel Rootkit that is developed for research and
demonstration purposes.
MEPHISTO is primarily inspired by Marvin, the depressive Rootkit and
the Rootkit Development seminar at the Technical University Munich.

## Why are the commits to this repository not signed?
Signatures should indicate that a piece of software is trustworthy, if
you trust the author(s) of this piece of software. As software like a
rootkit should never be trustworthy and you should always make sure that
it won't harm your system, commits to MEPHISTO won't be signed.

Because I usually sign all my commits, it may happen by accident, that
there might also be some signed commits in the repository over time.
Do not trust any commit, but review all the code carefully and execute
it only in secure environments like virtual machines created for this
special purpose.
